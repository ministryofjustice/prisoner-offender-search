  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>This service provides a number of endpoints for searching and reading prisoners that have been registered with the
    HMPPS prison service. This may be current or previous prisoners or other people that might be in secure hospitals.</p>
  <h2>Data provided</h2>
  <p>The vast majority of the data is sourced from the NOMIS system though in the future this is likely to change as
    more HMPPS prison data is held outside NOMIS.</p>
  <p>The data for a person is stored in Elastic Search and is updated after a record in NOMIS is changed. This is
    typically about a minute after the data is changed in NOMIS. In the unlikely circumstance that your service needs
    data that is 100% up to date with NOMIS then the <b>prison-api</b> might be a better service to use.
    One use case this might be appropriate for is if you need up-to-date data at the point a NOMIS prisoner event
    is received; this service also updates its records as result of NOMIS prisoner events, so you might encounter a race
    condition if your read is triggered from the same event.
  </p>
  <p>The data returned for each prisoner record is essentially a snapshot of key prisoner data. This includes the
    following:
  <ul>
    <li>Identifiers from both NOMIS and those held in other systems</li>
    <li>Personal details such as name and date of birth (including aliases)</li>
    <li>Current prison status such as the current location (including cell)</li>
    <li>Latest sentence details</li>
    <li>Alerts</li>
  </ul>
  See the schema definition for the API for full details.

  <h2>Types of endpoints</h2>
  <h3>Searching for a specific prisoner based on criteria</h3>
  <p>
    These are endpoints that use the core Elastic Search features to locate a prisoner record based on a set of criteria;
    for instance name, date of birth or unique identifier (such as the Police National Computer PNC number).
    Typically, they return many results and a summary of those results would be presented to an end user.
  </p>
  <h3>Matching records</h3>
  <p>
    Similar to searching but typically using a criteria from a different system; for instance, key data from a probation
    record or court record.
    These will use an algorithm that matches based on data that is likely to be most reliable for matching; for instance,
    PNC number or name with date of birth.
  </p>
  <h3>Retrieving a specific record</h3>
  <p>
    Retrieving a specific record typically by a unique identifier; for instance, prisoner number (aka NOMS number). This
    is a convenient way of viewing a summary of a prisoner record and is typically quicker than using the equivalent API
    in <b>prison-api</b>.
  </p>
  <h3>Retrieving batches of records</h3>
  <p>
    Retrieving a batch of records either by supplying a list of identifiers or a criteria that will a match many records;
    for instance, all people in a prison wing or people to be released on a specific date.
