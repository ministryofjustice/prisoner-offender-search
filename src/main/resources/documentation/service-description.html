<div>
  <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
  <p>This service provides a number of endpoints for searching and reading prisoners that have been registered with the
    HMPPS prison service. This may be current or previous prisoners or other people that might be in secure hospitals.</p>
  <h2 id="data-provided">Data provided</h2>
  <p>The vast majority of the data is sourced from the NOMIS system though in the future this is likely to change as
    more HMPPS prison data is held outside NOMIS.</p>
  <p>The data for a person is stored in Elastic Search and is updated after a record in NOMIS is changed. This is
    typically about a minute after the data is changed in NOMIS. In the unlikely circumstance that your service needs
    data that is 100% up to date with NOMIS then the
    <a href="https://api-dev.prison.service.justice.gov.uk/swagger-ui/index.html">prison-api</a>
    might be a better service to use.
    One use case this might be appropriate for is if you need up-to-date data at the point a NOMIS prisoner event
    is received; this service also updates its records as a result of NOMIS prisoner events, so you might encounter a race
    condition if your read is triggered from the same event.
  </p>
  <div>The data returned for each prisoner record is essentially a snapshot of key prisoner data. This includes the
    following:
  <ul>
    <li>Identifiers from both NOMIS and those held in other systems</li>
    <li>Personal details such as name and date of birth (including aliases)</li>
    <li>Current prison status such as the current location (including cell)</li>
    <li>Latest sentence details</li>
    <li>Alerts</li>
  </ul>
  See the schema definition for the API for full details.
  </div>
  <h2 id="role-restrictions">Role restrictions</h2>
  The following roles are currently in use in this service:
  <ul>
    <li>
      ROLE_PRISONER_SEARCH.  This role grants access to all of the search endpoints.
    </li>
    <li>
      ROLE_PRISONER_IN_PRISON_SEARCH. This role is limited to protect the "/prison/{prisonId}/prisoners" endpoint for
      clients that only need access to this endpoint in prisoner offender search.  For more general access the
      ROLE_PRISONER_SEARCH would be more suitable.
    </li>
    <li>
      ROLE_VIEW_PRISONER_DATA.  This role is only needed at present for the "/prisoner/{id}" endpoint to retrieve
      detailed information about a particular prisoner, as opposed to the rest of the search endpoints in this service
      that can return multiple matches.
    </li>
    <li>
      ROLE_GLOBAL_SEARCH.  This role is deprecated and replaced by the ROLE_PRISONER_SEARCH.  All of the endpoints in
      this service that accept this role also accept ROLE_PRISONER_SEARCH so the latter should be used in preference.
      It was originally created for Prison API and is still in use there.
    </li>
    <li>
      ROLE_PRISONER_INDEX.  This role is for internal use only - it is used to maintain the Elastic Search indexes that
      are used to hold the prisoner data.
    </li>
    <li>
      ROLE_EVENTS_ADMIN.  This role is only needed for the "/events/prisoner/received/{prisonerNumber}" endpoint
      and is only required in the event that a prisoner event wasn't raised by the service when their data in the service
      had changed.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="types-of-endpoints">Types of endpoints</h2>
  <h3>Searching for a specific prisoner based on criteria</h3>
  <p>
    These are endpoints that use the core Elastic Search features to locate a prisoner record based on a set of criteria;
    for instance name, date of birth or unique identifier (such as the Police National Computer PNC number).
    Typically, they return many results and a summary of those results would be presented to an end user.
  </p>
  <h3>Matching records</h3>
  <p>
    Similar to searching but typically using a criteria from a different system; for instance, key data from a probation
    record or court record.
    These will use an algorithm that matches based on data that is likely to be most reliable for matching; for instance,
    PNC number or name with date of birth.
  </p>
  <h3>Retrieving a specific record</h3>
  <p>
    Retrieving a specific record typically by a unique identifier; for instance, prisoner number (aka NOMS number). This
    is a convenient way of viewing a summary of a prisoner record and is typically quicker than using the equivalent API
    in <b>prison-api</b>.
  </p>
  <h3>Retrieving batches of records</h3>
  <p>
    Retrieving a batch of records either by supplying a list of identifiers or a criteria that will a match many records;
    for instance, all people in a prison wing or people to be released on a specific date.
  </p>
  <h3>HMPPS Domain Events</h3>
  <div>
    This service also raises HMPPS domain events. This is done by analysing deltas when the record is updated in Elastic Search.

  <p>
    Since these events can only be derived from changes that this service detects these events can not be considered the source of truth
    but a side effect of other services - NOMIS being the source of the vast majority of changes.
    So this is a good source when it is important that the Elastic Search datastore has already been updated where otherwise a NOMIS prisoner event could cause a race condition.
    However, since the majority of changes are sourced by NOMIS amendments the business events reflect what have been entered into NOMIS rather than real world;
    for example occasionally there maybe a release and receive event in quick succession for the same prisoner simply because there has been some administrative changes in NOMIS rather than the prisoner
    has actually been released and received within a few minutes. A client might wish to use `prisoner-offender-events` that are delivered slower but are more likely to reflect real world changes rather
    than just NOMIS changes. If a client is more interested in when changes are made in NOMIS than these services events are more appropriate.
